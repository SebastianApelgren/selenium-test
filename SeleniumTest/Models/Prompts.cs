As the html code is too long to be sent all at once, you will be given half of the code at a time.
If you find the CSS selector matching the description you are given, you should return it and only it.
If you don't find it, you should return 'Not found'. These are the only two responses you will give.
Below is the CSS selector description you will be given:

<Description>
{0}
</Description>";
